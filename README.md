Proud Terra Makefile
====================

This is a [Terra](http://github.com/terra-ops/terra-cli) makefile to configure
a development environment for the [Proud Drupal distribution](http://github.com/proudcity/proud).

The installation profile, all apps and all contributed modules that are frequetly edited are all
downloaded with git.

Requirements:
* Drush
* [drupalorg_drush](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalorg_drush)

Note:
* You probably will want to edit the `./git/config` files in `sites/all/modules/dev` to include your username
(change from `http://` to `jlyon@`).
